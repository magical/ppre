PPRE - Project Pokemon ROM Editor

Open source editor for Pokemon games. WTFPL licensed.

If you are just looking to run PPRE, you don't want this branch. This branch
is an attempt to clean up the awful mess of spaghetti code that is PPRE.
Due to the extensive nature of the changes in here, PPRE may not work
properly, or even run. You have been warned.



Cleanup plan:

    1. The first phase will be untangling the core logic from the GUI.
       Also documenting the data structures used by PPRE and in the games.

    2. The second phase will be cleaning up the GUI code to be more Pythonic
       and to follow PEP 8.

    3. ???

Cleanup is currently in PHASE 1.



Sins commited by PPRE:

    * Does not adhere to PEP 8

       There's no excuse for this.

       http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    * Uses eval and exec

       I'm gonna blame Qt Designer for this. However, nothing PPRE does with
       eval couldn't be done with getattr() and setattr().

       The better solution, in the long run, is to make liberal use of
       lists and dictionaries.

    * No documentation

       * Functions and classes are missing docstrings
       * Magic constants abound with no explanation of what they are for
       * None of the data structures which PPRE reads are documented
       * and so on

       Gonna gather up the constants and give them nice, symbolic names.

    * Requires WINE to run on linux

       There is no reason for this. The two programs PPRE uses WINE to run
       are ndstool and xdelta.

       xdelta is open source and is widely available in linux distros. There
       might even be bindings for Python.

       ndstool is also open source, but i can't get it to compile.

       One option is to grab the Nitro parsing code from
       http://git.veekun.com/porigon-z and do the dump natively.

       Another is to fork ndstool.

    * Does not separate presentation logic and application logic

       The code for parsing the games' data structures is right there in
       the GUI code.
