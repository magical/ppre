PPRE - Project Pokemon ROM Editor

Open source editor for Pokemon games. Licensed under WTFPL.


This branch is for cleaning up PPRE, which is an awful mess of spaghetti code.

Sins commited by PPRE:
    
    * Not adhering to PEP 8
       
       http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

    * Use of eval and exec
       
       I'm gonna blame Qt designer for this. However, nothing PPRE does with 
       eval couldn't be done with getattr() and setattr(). Better solution 
       is to use lists.

    * Magic constants everywhere

       Mostly related to offsets in the rom and various mapping tables.

       Gonna gather these up, document them, and give them nice, symbolic
       names.

    * Requires WINE to run on linux
       ...so it can run ndstool and xdelta. 

       xdelta is open source and is widely available in linux distros. There
       might even be bindings for Python.

       ndstool is also open source, but i can't get it to compile.
       An alternative is to grab the Nitro parsing code from 
       http://git.veekun.com/porigon-z and do the dump natively.
